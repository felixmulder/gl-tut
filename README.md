gl-tut
======

Examples for learning OpenGL. This is done using the tutorial found on [Arcsynthesis](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html).

The dependencies on GLUT/freeglut have been removed. The focus of this project
is to get a good understanding of the OpenGL pipeline without relying on heavy
frameworks and utilizing a modern version of OpenGL.

The project relies on GLFW for window rendering, which should make this fairly
cross platform.
